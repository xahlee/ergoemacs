# How To Contribute to ErgoEmacs #

  * Read the [Developer Intro](DeveloperIntro.md) in the wiki section.
  * Go to the Issues tab.
  * Find a item.
  * post your code as comment to that issue.

A developer will grab it and check in.

If you like, just email a developer or post to [ErgoEmacs Forum](http://groups.google.com/group/ergoemacs) to be added to the project so you can checkin yourself. (please make sure the code quality is reasonable)

If a item is listed in [Developer Intro](DeveloperIntro.md) but does not appear in Issues tab, and is not shown as Done, please create a item in Issues. I just haven't had time to add all items.
