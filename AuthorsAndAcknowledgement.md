... to be written here... itemized names and deeds, possibly with date...

(if you are a developer, or have helped, please feel free to add
yourself here, or edit the above. David, Maybe we should have this as
part of the distro, or even move it there ...

i'd like this credit page to be accurate in tech detail, yet still
readable to non coders so people can get a overview of who are behind
this project, and a sense of proportions of their contributors.

In GNU Emacs, and perhaps many other open source projects, its
non-trivial to know who really did what to what proportion of the
project. Most of the time, we just know one single leader. Or a list
of details in technical jargons that one cannot get a sense of
pie-chart by significance of contributions by developers.

For example, emacs 23's unicode implementation is extremely
significant and non-trivial, but it is very hard to find out who
actually did most of the hard work on this. (it is Kenichi Handa)
Geeks are often secretive, and the credit is also sensitive to
contributors, so, often, it's just glossed over and not much talked
about.)
